# Arduino-based-gas-detection-project-with-potentiometer
This Arduino project simulates gas detection using a potentiometer and a temperature sensor. It activates an LED when the temperature exceeds a threshold and triggers a buzzer when the potentiometer simulates high gas levels. Real-time readings for both are displayed on the Serial Monitor.
